            <h2 class="box-header">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>How might we improve awareness and access to mental health care supports for at-risk Canadians? Create an
                empathetic, inclusive solution that helps connect at-risk Canadians with publicly-available mental
                health supports. It should educate them on available services and empower them to take care of their
                mental health.</p>
            <!-- <h2>Our Solution - Mello</h2> -->
            <h2>Our Innovation</h2>
            <p class="main-p"><b>Using affordances to provide support during panic attacks</b></p>
            <p>To excel in this design-a-thon, we recognized the importance of delivering our solution through an
                accessible medium, such as a website or app. However, our decision to opt for these mediums required
                careful justification.</p>
            <p>As we faced the judges' inquiries, a pivotal question emerged: "Why an app?" We realized that our app
                must distinguish itself not for the sake of being an app, but by harnessing native features for maximum
                impact.</p>
            <h3>Utilizing Shortcuts</h3>
            <p>Opening an app takes many steps. What if someone's having a panic attack and can't do all that? So, we
                had an idea. What if you could get help right from your lock screen? Using shortcuts, such as a double
                press of the power button, we could get them help quickly.</p>
            <h3>Non-Touch Alternative</h3>
            <p>Panic attacks look different for everyone. During interviews, users told us their hands shake a lot
                during an episode. To ensure accessibility, we introduced a non-touch alternative with voice activation.
                This is similar to how you can call the Google Assistant by saying “Ok Google.” Users can also call for
                assistance by saying "Hello Mello."</p>
            <h3>Activation Protocol</h3>
            <p>Again, panic attacks look very different for different people, and people have different methods of
                coping with them. In our research, we found the 5-4-3-2-1 method to be the most effective. This means
                that when you feel panicked, the device will prompt you to identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you
                can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. However, if users
                have a different preferred coping style, they can select that from a few common options provided during
                onboarding. <br><br></p>
            <h4 class="not-bold-heading">“But hey, if the person already knows how to cope with a panic attack, why do they need you?”</h4>
            <p><br>During our conversations with potential users, we realized that during a panic attack, individuals may
                find it challenging to remember and effectively implement coping techniques. Further research revealed
                that this can be because of cognitive impairment, physical symptoms, or emotional overload. Having
                support present can make coping with a panic attack much easier.</p>
            <h3>Understanding Context</h3>
            <p>Panic attacks can occur anywhere, posing concerns about public visibility. Users, fearing judgment,
                valued their privacy during panic attacks. To address this, we introduced a choice during
                onboarding—users can opt for sound or no sound during panic attack responses.</p>
            <p>Providing the choice of sound or no sound respects users' privacy during panic attacks, allowing them to
                manage their experience discreetly in public spaces and minimizing potential judgment from others.
                <br></p>
            <p>So, we had to think of solutions that focused on visuals and other senses. One thing that stood out to us
                was the potential for haptic feedback. How could we use vibrations to guide them through the 5-4-3-2-1
                or other breathing techniques?</p>
            <h3>Designing for Impairments</h3>
            <p>Visual impairments, like blurred vision and light sensitivity during panic attacks, guided our design. We
                incorporated high contrast, dark mode visuals, and multiple cues to accommodate these impairments.
                <br></p>
            <p>Considering potential hand numbness or trembling, we recognized the need for alternative communication
                methods. Our solution utilizes multiple communication methods to cater to diverse user needs.</p>
            <!-- <h3>Putting it all together - How would the solution work?</h3>
            <p>Let’s take the 5-4-3-2-1 method as an example. Short vibrations would help users count and long
                vibrations would indicate a change in instruction.</p> -->

                <h2>The Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm so proud to say that our pitch won us the <b>first place</b> in this UX Design Jam by Sun Life Financial. A few key details that the judges appreciated are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Our cute mascot (Mello the marshmallow).</li>
                        <li>Our consideration for the context surrounding people's financial situations and insurance providers.</li>
                        <li>Our haptic innovation (as outlined in this case study).</li>
                        <li>Our pitching strategy with a focus on telling the story of a specific persona using the app.</li>
                    </ol>
