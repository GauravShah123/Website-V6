        <p>As a UX designer turned product manager, I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to balance both worlds. It’s not always clear when to lean into your skills and when to step back. This is a reflection on the lessons I learned by doing, messing up, and trying again.</p>
        <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
        <p>When I was building my portfolio for my first co-op, I had no idea how to position myself. I liked UX. I also liked product. But it felt like I had to pick a side. If I wanted to be taken seriously as a PM, I thought I had to drop the design label altogether. At the same time, I was applying to UX jobs. It was confusing. I didn’t know how to talk about myself. <br><br>
            
            Then one of my professors said something that completely shifted my mindset. “You sit at the intersection of PM and Design. That’s not a weakness. That’s your edge.” That stuck with me. <br><br>
            
            That was lesson 1. Embrace your strengths. Even if they don’t fit neatly into one role.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>To shift users' mindset towards investing, we leveraged their positive association with e-commerce websites.
            Instead of tying investing to income, we associated it with their spending habits. By asking if they could
            set aside a small percentage of their planned purchase, we gradually introduced them to investing. Our
            browser extension allowed users to save while shopping, offering practical application of learned concepts.
            Our unique value proposition was to help beginners learn and save slowly, ultimately becoming confident
            investors. The browser extension streamlined the process, linking to a website and app for investment
            monitoring and financial education.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>Our project stood out, being selected in the top 4% worldwide. We achieved an impressive 80% user adoption
            rate, generated over 20 promising leads, and identified a total available market of $151M. My key takeaways
            include the significance of process, the nuances of copywriting, and the remarkable benefits of auto-layout
            in Figma.</p>
