        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>With rising inflation, traditional saving methods became ineffective, making investing a necessity. Our
            survey indicated that 56% of young individuals expressed interest in investing but didn't take action due to
            factors like lack of knowledge, income, fear of loss, and limited time. Negative emotions and a sense of
            alienation further discouraged them from exploring investment opportunities.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>To shift users' mindset towards investing, we leveraged their positive association with e-commerce websites.
            Instead of tying investing to income, we associated it with their spending habits. By asking if they could
            set aside a small percentage of their planned purchase, we gradually introduced them to investing. Our
            browser extension allowed users to save while shopping, offering practical application of learned concepts.
            Our unique value proposition was to help beginners learn and save slowly, ultimately becoming confident
            investors. The browser extension streamlined the process, linking to a website and app for investment
            monitoring and financial education.</p>
        <img src="/Works/InvestMint/Investmint.gif" alt="Browser Extension Demo">
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>Our project stood out, being selected in the top 4% worldwide. We achieved an impressive 80% user adoption
            rate, generated over 20 promising leads, and identified a total available market of $151M. My key takeaways
            include the significance of process, the nuances of copywriting, and the remarkable benefits of auto-layout
            in Figma.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a high school student, finance has captivated me. I thrive on analyzing markets and
                constructing robust portfolios through qualitative and quantitative methods. Yet, I've observed a
                puzzling trend among my college friends who, despite their interest in personal finance, shy away from
                investing. This has piqued my curiosity and led me to wonder, <b>"What is the reason behind the
                    disconnect between young people and investing?‚Äù</b></p>
            <p> During the Young Tycoons Business Competition, where I led as the CEO and managed UX and Marketing for
                our team, we tackled this very issue. As students of Indian descent, our focus was on the Indian market,
                evident through the presence of <b>‚Çπ</b> symbols and Indian news headlines throughout our project.</p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>While I stuck to the overarching principles of the double diamond process, I tailored and adapted my
                approach to align with the specific business requirements and time constraints of the competition.</p>
            <!-- <h3>//ADD PROCESS DIAGRAM</h3> -->

            <h2>Problem Validation</h2>
            <p>I undertook problem validation through two distinct stages: extensive news research and conducting a
                comprehensive survey.</p>
            <img src="/Works/InvestMint/1.png" alt="News reports from Indian news channels">
            <h3>Research Insights</h3>
            <p>With rising inflation, saving like we did 30 years ago no longer works. Investing is increasingly
                becoming a necessity. News reports and mass population studies only confirmed our hypothesis that the
                lack of investing among the youth was a widespread issue.</p>
            <p>After conducting a survey among the alumni and current students of our high school, We also found out
                that
                <b>56% (43 respondents)</b> expressed an interest in investing their money but are not yet doing so.
                This data
                implies that there is a potential market for investment opportunities among young people, but that they
                may need education or support to get started.
            </p>

            <h2>Identifying Pain Points</h2>
            <p>Our survey and empathy map revealed some key pain points that prevented people from investing. They are
                listed below in the order of decreasing popularity.</p>

                    <b>Empathizing with the user</b>
                    <p>Our assumption was that the root cause lies in their mindset. We drew analogies to the
                        psychological factors that cause procrastination, as the reasons that many choose not to invest
                        are also emotional. People hear about how everyone around them is investing and feel alienated.
                        This causes them to develop negative feelings towards investing and keeps them trapped in a
                        negative feedback loop.</p>

            <p><br>These how might we statements gave us a clear road to defining a solution. However, before proceeding
                further, I needed to conduct a market analysis of the market to understand the customers, current
                players and the gap in the market.</p>

            <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Market Segmentation</h3>
            <p>I segmented the market based on intention, level of knowledge and income. I firmly believe that this
                behavioral and psychographic segmentation approach surpasses a simple demographic segmentation, allowing
                us to reach a broader audience.</p>

            <p>The idea of investing apps in India is relatively new and hence most apps are targeted towards
                knowledgeable investors. We saw a <b>clear need</b> for more education focused investment services. With
                the gap in the market clear, we were ready to develop our product further.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
            <p>
                Sita Patel, a recent college graduate, became our guiding persona through user interviews and in-depth
                survey analysis. Understanding her financial behaviors, goals, pain points, and motivations allowed us
                to empathize with her and develop a product that resonated with Sita and others seeking to improve their
                financial habits.</p>
            <img src="/Works/InvestMint/5.png" alt="User Persona - Sita Patel" class="small-image">
            <h2>Defining the Solution</h2>
            <h3>Brainstorming a Solution</h3>
            <p>A trend that we noticed among our target audience was a heavy reliance on e-commerce websites. What if we
                could piggyback off the positive associations they had with them?</p>
            <h3>High Level Concept</h3>
            <p class="main-p"><b>Honey + Khan Academy for investing</b></p>
            <p>We needed to create a shift in the users‚Äô mindset. So instead of tying investing to their income, we
                associated it with their spending. We asked the question, <b>"If you have $1,000 to spend on a new
                    iPhone, do you think you can set aside 10% ($100) to invest?"</b></p>
            <p>We could enhance this further by partnering with coupon code extensions such as Honey. By doing this, any
                money saved during online shopping can be redirected to their investment account.</p>
            <p>We could then gradually introduce investing concepts and let them invest using the money they saved up in
                this account. This would also enable them to practically apply the concepts they learned for better
                understanding and retention.</p>
            <p>This shift in mindset would be our unique value proposition.</p>

            <div class="callout">

                <div class="callout-content">
                    <b>Unique Value Proposition</b>
                    <p>We are investing service for the beginner, helping them learn and save slowly as you shop so that
                        one day, you can become a confident investor.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>A Change in Medium</h3>
            <p>To effectively reach customers on e-commerce sites, we would have to change the way that we deliver our
                solution. Instead of an app or website, we needed to primarily be a <b>browser extension.</b> This
                intentional decision effectively <b>reduced friction points</b>, enabling effortless savings during
                online shopping. We could then link a website and app so that the users could monitor their investments
                and educate themselves on financial concepts.</p>

            <h2>Developing the Solution</h2>
            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>In addition to the browser extension, InvestMint offered a comprehensive suite of services. This
                information architecture diagram showcases the linked website, which allows users to effortlessly
                monitor their portfolio, make investments, access concise educational resources, and manage account
                settings.</p>

            <h3>Onboarding Flow</h3>
            <p>Based on the information architecture, I identified the necessary user information during initial
                sign-in. Our goal was to uphold our value of simplicity, ensuring an effortless onboarding flow while
                gathering all essential data from the user.</p>

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>
                When designing a prototype for a browser extension like Investmint, UI design plays a crucial role in
                creating a seamless and user-friendly experience. The extension must be easy to navigate, with clear
                calls to action and intuitive functionality. Users should have no difficulty understanding how to use
                the extension and accomplishing their desired goals.</p>

            <p>I started with a basic content inventory for the browser extension and progressed to designing
                <b>multiple iterations</b>. Throughout each stage, I sought <b>feedback from our target demographic</b>,
                continuously improving our design to enhance functionality.
            </p><br>
            <img src="/Works/InvestMint/8.png" alt="Multiple design iterations for the UI prototype">
            <br>
            <p>Below, you can see how we envision our extension to function. This GIF was created by prototyping the
                design in Figma. Users can easily check the order amount and the corresponding percentage and dollar
                value allocated to their investment account. They can then confirm the transaction, initiating a
                transfer of funds from their bank account to their investment wallet.</p><br>
            <img src="/Works/InvestMint/Investmint.gif" alt="Demonstration of the browser extension">

            <h2>Assessing the Solution</h2>
            <h3>Addressing the HMW Statements</h3>
            <p>At this stage, we thought it would be best to look back at out HMW statements and see if our solution was
                able to achieve the goals we set out to accomplish. </p>


            <p class="first hmw-checked"><b><input type="checkbox" checked>How might we practically educate users about investing
                    concepts?</b></p>
            <p class="no-top-margin">We drew inspiration from the Google Primer app and implemented 5-minute lessons to
                teach investing concepts in smaller, easily digestible chunks. Busy users like our persona, Sita, can
                learn at their own pace. Your progress is saved and you can also choose from various levels based on
                your existing knowledge level.</p>

            <p class="first hmw-checked"><b><input type="checkbox" checked>How might we encourage gradual savings in an investment
                    account?</b></p>
            <p class="no-top-margin">By linking investing to a part of our users routine life, we can make investing a
                habit easily. In addition to this, we also gave them the option to add funds directly from their bank
                accounts to make additional investments once they felt comfortable. </p>
            <p class="first hmw-checked"><b><input type="checkbox" checked>How might we boost user confidence in investing
                    decisions?</b></p>
            <p class="no-top-margin">In the beginning, we don‚Äôt expect our users to save a lot. The small amount saved
                can be invested gradually as they learn more. This exposure should build up confidence.</p>
            <p>By displaying minimal information and graphs in favour of more average long term statistics, we can also
                prevent anxiety while making the decision. Once they complete certain modules, we can encourage them to
                perform research beyond the app to figure out which stocks and ETFs might be a good fit for them.</p>
            <p>In the future, we also need to consider effective copy to inspire confidence and eliminate panic during
                poor economic conditions.</p>
            <p class="first hmw-checked"><b><input type="checkbox" checked>How might we make the investing process quick and
                    intuitive?</b></p>
            <p class="no-top-margin">While our original idea was to provide stock recommendations, we soon decided
                against it to prevent liability. A portfolio should be chosen based on personal goals, risk tolerance
                and other factors, not because of a recommendation.</p>
            <p>Thus, we settled on creating a simple user flow and testing it to ensure that it met the design goals. We
                feel that making the process any more quick or intuitive may cross ethical boundaries. </p>


            <h3>Scalability Analysis</h3>
            <p>While developing a good product was a priority, we also had to make sure that we could build a scalable
                business as well. Therefore performing a market analysis at this stage was necessary.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <h3>üîç Process is important</h3>
            <p>I never fully understood the importance of following the steps in the UX design process until this
                project. Having a user to empathize with and conducting firsthand research (such as surveys) made
                brainstorming a solution much easier. Utilizing an information architecture map, sketches, and
                wireframes guided our design process and saved us numerous hours.</p>

            <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Copywriting is tricky</h3>
            <p>The words on an interface can make or break the user experience. We went through several brainstorming
                sessions on how to write effective copy but it was tricky to balance simplicity and useful information.
                In fact, if I had more time, I would work on this further.</p>

            <h3>ü§© Auto-layout is amazing</h3>
            <p>I had the opportunity to learn auto-layout in Figma for this project. After having it used it here, I
                don‚Äôt think I can ever go back to absolutely positioning things again. It worked so well when I needed
                to adjust components, making them fit just right.</p>
