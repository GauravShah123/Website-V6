## The problem

As a freelance consultant, I have to maintain my time sheet to send accurate invoices. While doing this in an excel sheet works, it still leaves the invoice creation and tracking to be a manual process. In an attempt to be more organized with my work, I created an invoice tracker to help me log my hours, make invoices and track them.

## Implementation

The invoice tracker is a vibe coded project built as a simple web-app. The tool is only meant for me, so instead of building out an extensive backend, I decided to use `localStorage` to house my data. 

## The solution

I believe in showing, not telling. So, instead of a long-winded explanation, why don’t you play around with the tool yourself? If you’d prefer a step-by-step walkthrough, keep scrolling.
