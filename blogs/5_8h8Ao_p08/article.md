Over the past few months, working with designers and designing myself, I’ve constantly asked: what makes a good designer?

After a lot of thought, I think the answer is adaptability.

Some of the best designers I’ve worked with know how to flex their process when resources, timelines, or roles shift. In this article, I want to break down three insights on the design process, based on my own experience as a product designer.

## Use tools when you need them

In early-stage startups or scrappy teams, you rarely get the luxury of a full textbook design process. And honestly, even when you do have the time and resources, maybe you still shouldn’t follow it to the letter. I’ve joked before that I’m the PM who “doesn’t believe in lo-fi.” But the truth is, it’s not that lo-fi is bad; it’s that the way we teach the design process is a bit broken.

Over the years, I’ve started thinking of design steps like lo-fi mockups or crazy 8s not as mandatory checkpoints, but as tools. You pull them out when they’re useful. This shift actually started during a consulting course I took, where I noticed something interesting. Consultants don’t solve problems by rigidly sticking to one process. They draw from a toolbox of frameworks (Porter’s Five Forces, SWOT, AIDA) and apply the right one based on the problem. That idea stuck with me. Maybe design should work the same way.

Let’s say you’re building a complex product and need stakeholder alignment before investing weeks into a polished flow. Sure, lo-fi is perfect for that. But if you’re working on a simple error modal, maybe you don’t need to waste time aligning grey rectangles in Figma. Use the right tool for the job. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Research as a proxy for exploration

As much as we hate to admit it, a lot of design problems aren’t new. Many of them are solved. Login flows, onboarding patterns, empty states. They’ve all been done a hundred times. So instead of reinventing the wheel, it’s often smarter to start with research. Use it to figure out what already works, and build from there.

This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t explore. It just means we should be strategic about where we do it. For most products, I’d argue the majority of a designer’s time should go toward refining and improving the main value prop. That’s where deep thinking and iteration matter most. By applying best practices to the more routine flows, you free up time and energy to go deeper on the parts that truly differentiate your product.

Of course, if your app is doing something completely new or the existing patterns just don’t fit, then go ahead and explore. The point isn’t to avoid exploration. The point is to be intentional about it. Every minute you spend redesigning a login screen is a minute you could have used improving the core experience. Make sure the tradeoff is worth it.

## Prioritization

I first learned this as a PM, but it’s made me a better designer too. You’re not evaluated by how well you follow a process. You’re evaluated by how effectively you solve the user’s problem. If you’re cutting steps, that’s fine, but only if you’re staying laser-focused on the user’s pain points. Every decision you make should tie back to that.

There are two areas where prioritization really matters: how much time you spend on each feature or flow, and how much time you spend on each step in the process. For the first one, focus on the flows that deliver your core value prop or the parts of the product where users spend most of their time. That’s where you get the most return on your effort. For the second, identify what you actually need to get the job done. If a problem is well-defined and straightforward, maybe you don’t need extensive discovery or multiple rounds of wireframes. Maybe you just need to execute.

Being ruthless with prioritization doesn’t mean your work gets sloppy. Even without detailed research or polished UX deliverables, you can still build great products. Validate through internal testing, gather quick feedback, and constantly check alignment with the problem you’re solving. That’s more valuable than a beautifully crafted persona doc that nobody uses.

## Conclusion

Even if you’re not doing lo-fis or crazy 8s every time, the key beats of a design thinking process—empathize, ideate, define, prototype and test—still matter. What this article argues is that your design process shouldn’t be fixed. It should evolve depending on what the project demands.

And this isn’t a radical idea. In iterative product work (say, optimizing an existing feature) we already think this way. We adjust based on context. So why not take the same approach for 0-to-1 products?

Instead of starting with a fixed process, start with the user and their problem. Let the process emerge from there. If you’re solving a complex, ambiguous problem, do user interviews. If you’re stuck and need ideas, try crazy 8s. Build your process as you go, using only what you need. And at every step, ask yourself: does this still tie back to the problem we set out to solve?

If the answer is yes, you’re on the right track.
