            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Throughout my journey of designing and developing websites, I've encountered a recurring challenge:
                navigation menus. Creating a menu that is both visually appealing and user-friendly has proven to be
                quite a daunting task. I've come across countless beautifully designed navigation menus online, but
                sadly, their usability often left much to be desired. These experiences inspired me to take a closer
                look at one of my previous portfolio's navigation menus, determined to enhance it. To achieve this, I
                delved into extensive research, seeking out the best UX practices that would guide its transformation.
            </p>
            <h3>Mobile First Frenzy</h3>
            <p>A few years ago, I stumbled upon the concept of "mobile-first" design - crafting websites with mobile
                phones in mind. It made sense, especially when it came to coding websites. Starting with the bare
                essentials and then progressively adding more content using media queries seemed like a smart approach.
                However, I soon found myself juggling two different versions of the navigation menu for mobile and
                desktop. Unlike other page elements, transforming a horizontal navigation menu into a hamburger menu
                proved to be far from straightforward. In an attempt to streamline my workflow and save time, I made the
                decision to use hamburger menus exclusively for most of my projects. But little did I know, this choice
                came with its own set of drawbacks.</p>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>So, here's the challenge: how can we leverage research-backed modifications to enhance the usability and
                conversions of the traditional hamburger menu commonly used on portfolio websites?</p>
            <h2>The Original</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, the transition to hamburger menus brought forth several disadvantages that significantly
                affected the overall user experience:</p>
            <img src="original.png" alt="The Original">

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b> Discoverability </b>became a major concern, as the ambiguous hamburger icon often went
                        unnoticed
                        by users, making it difficult for them to find and access navigation options.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The <b>lack of visibility</b> and <b>contextual awareness</b> within the menu compounded the
                        problem. Users struggled to understand where they were in the website's structure, leading to
                        delays
                        in finding the desired content.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>On top of that, the <b> interaction cost</b> increased. Users had to perform an extra tap or
                        click
                        to access essential navigation options, which could be frustrating and time-consuming.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Clearly, a nav menu redesign based on accessibility and UX principles was necessary to ensure a
                functional, reliable, usable, and pleasurable experience for users.</p>
            <h2>Revamping the Hamburger Menu</h2>
            <a class="figma-button"

            </a>
            <p>To tackle the UX issues with the navigation menu, I embarked on a series of steps that would
                significantly improve its usability. Let's dive into each of these steps:</p>
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Simpler Navigation Titles</h3>
            <p>By using concise and scannable text, I could improve user scanning speed and reduce reaction time.
                According to the Nielsen Norman Group, this approach resulted in a remarkable 58% and 47% improvement in
                usability.</p>
            <p class="source">(Source: <a
                    href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/concise-scannable-and-objective-how-to-write-for-the-web/">Nielsen
                    Norman Group</a>)</p>
            <img src="Edit 1.png" alt="Simpler Navigation Titles">
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Visible Desktop Navigation</h3>
            <p>Here's an interesting finding: visible navigation menus outperformed hidden hamburger menus in terms of
                discoverability. Studies from the Nielsen Norman Group showed a significant 43% disparity in navigation
                usage between a hamburger menu and a visible navigation menu on desktop sites.</p>
            <p class="source">(Source: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/">Nielsen
                    Norman Group</a>)</p>
            <p> So, I decided to make the navigation menu visible, not only enhancing usability but also improving
                accessibility, saving precious time for users and even benefiting SEO.</p>
            <img src="Edit 2.png" alt="Visible Desktop Navigation">
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Logo Integration</h3>
            <p>It turns out that prominently displaying the logo in the navigation menu is absolutely critical. Research
                by the Nielsen Norman Group found that placing the logo in the top left corner resulted in a staggering
                89% higher brand recall compared to other placement locations.</p>
            <p class="source">(Source: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/logo-placement-brand-recall/">Nielsen
                    Norman Group</a>)</p>
            <p> Over the years, the logo has also taken on a secondary role as a link to the home page.</p>
            <img src="Edit 3.png" alt="Logo Integration">
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Adding the CTA</h3>
            <p>To drive user engagement and boost conversions, I strategically placed CTAs within the navigation menu.
                While the exact increase in conversions varied based on factors such as the website's target audience,
                industry, and design, studies have shown improvements ranging from 10% to 30% or more.</p>
            <img src="Edit 4.png" alt="Adding the CTA">

            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Adding Color</h3>
            <p>By adding color to the mix, I effectively highlighted important elements, making the logo and
                call-to-action stand out. Color is particularly effective at aiding scannability, ensuring that sighted
                users can easily distinguish and focus on these crucial elements.</p>
            <img src="Edit 5.png" alt="Adding Color">
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Adding Active and Hover States</h3>
            <p>To enhance user understanding of component status, I incorporated visual signals for active and hover
                states. Clear visual cues communicate the current page and indicate the destination, making navigation
                more intuitive and reducing confusion. Without hover states, interactive portions may go unnoticed,
                resulting in missed content and disrupted conversion paths.</p>
            <img src="Edit 6.png" alt="Adding Active and Hover States">
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Adding a Subtle Drop Shadow</h3>
            <p>By creating the illusion of the navigation menu being "on top of" the page content, I improved its
                visibility and ensured clear differentiation from the rest of the page.</p>
            <img src="Edit 7.png" alt="Adding a Subtle Drop Shadow">
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Moving Mobile Navigation to the Bottom</h3>
            <p>Recognizing user behavior, research revealed that most users navigate with a single thumb on their
                phones. So, I shifted the mobile navigation menu to the bottom. This change acknowledges the way users
                interact with their devices making sure they can easily reach the menu without straining. It might
                challenge established mental models, but I strongly believe the trade-off is well worth it.</p>
            <img src="Edit 8.png" alt="Moving Mobile Navigation to the Bottom">
            <!-- Point -->
            <h3 class="list-h3">Modifying the Mobile Navigation</h3>
            <p>When it came to the mobile navigation, I explored two approaches:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Version 1:</b> I replaced the hamburger with icons and labels, creating a navigation style
                        reminiscent of mobile apps. This approach maintains mental models and enhances discoverability,
                        as many mobile apps use bottom navigation with labels. I also added active states to provide
                        user feedback.</p>
                    <img src="Edit 9 - Version 1.png" alt="Modifying the Mobile Navigation - Version 1">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Version 2:</b> In this version, I transformed the navigation into a combination of visible and
                        hidden links. Studies have shown that combination menus outperform hamburgers by 1.5 times.
                    </p>
                    <p class="source">(Source: <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/">Nielsen
                            Norman Group</a>)</p>
                    <p>
                        Visible links improve discoverability and support scalability for additional website pages.
                        These modifications optimize user experience and navigation efficiency on mobile devices.</p>
                    <img src="Edit 9 - Version 2.png" alt="Modifying the Mobile Navigation - Version 2">
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>To enhance accessibility, I implemented various modifications and adhered to best practices. Take a look
                at the modified website to see the improvements I made and discover the steps taken to enhance its
                accessibility.</p>

            <h3>Source Code Snippet</h3><br>
            <img src="Code.png" alt="Source Code for the Updated Navigation Menu">
            <p>Here's a rundown of the key changes:</p>
            <h3 class="list-h3">Proper Semantic Structure</h3>
            <p>I utilized semantic HTML elements such as <code>nav</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>button</code>,
                <code>ul</code>, and <code>li</code> to provide a clear and meaningful structure for the navigation
                menu, ensuring that it's well-organized and accessible.
            </p>
            <h3 class="list-h3">Alternative Text for Images</h3>
            <p>To cater to screen readers, I added descriptive alternative text to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element
                using the <code>alt</code> attribute. This ensures that users who cannot view the images can still
                understand their purpose.</p>
            <h3 class="list-h3">ARIA Labels and Attributes</h3>
            <p>To assist users with disabilities, I included appropriate ARIA labels and attributes in the navigation
                elements. For example, the logo's <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element has an <code>aria-label</code>
                attribute providing a descriptive label ("Home") for screen readers. The hamburger menu button includes
                attributes such as <code>aria-label</code>, <code>aria-expanded</code>, and <code>aria-hidden</code> to
                convey its purpose and state to assistive technologies.</p>
            <h3 class="list-h3">Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>By implementing responsive design techniques, I ensured that the navigation menu adapts seamlessly to
                different screen sizes. On mobile devices, a compact and accessible hamburger menu is used, making it
                easier for users to navigate the website.</p>
            <h3 class="list-h3">Keyboard Accessibility</h3>
            <p>I made the hamburger menu button (<code>&lt;button&gt;</code>) focusable and activatable using the
                keyboard, guaranteeing that users who rely on keyboard navigation can easily access the menu
                functionality.</p>
            <h3 class="list-h3">Dynamic ARIA Label Updates</h3>
            <p>To provide accurate and up-to-date information to screen readers, I dynamically update the ARIA label of
                the navigation button when the menu is expanded or collapsed. This gives users real-time feedback on the
                current state of the navigation menu.</p>
            <h3 class="list-h3">Proper Focus Management</h3>
            <p>When the navigation menu is opened, I ensure that the focus is automatically shifted to the first menu
                item, allowing keyboard users to continue navigating the menu without any interruption.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, by challenging the limitations of the traditional hamburger menu and incorporating
                research-backed modifications, I transformed a clunky and hidden navigation into an engaging and
                accessible experience. After all the modifications, I am still left with a few next steps and questions.
            </p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>To further assess the impact of these modifications, I plan to conduct a multivariate test comparing the
                original and final versions. This test will help determine whether the combined changes amplify the
                benefits or potentially negate each other. Additionally, there are several questions that require deeper
                investigation:</p>
            <h3>Further Questions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Does the mobile navigation menu perform better when at the top or bottom of the page?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Does a mobile navigation perform better if it includes icons and labels or a combination of links
                        and a hamburger menu? </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What would be the best way to incorporate a search bar into the menu?</p>
