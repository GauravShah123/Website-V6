        <h1>Why Product?</h1>
        <p>My journey into product management traces back to my early days, when I ran a design agency in grade 8,
            linking folks globally through design. That's where the love affair with design's impact began. Then, a high
            school finance competition sparked my fascination with money's role in growth. Business and finance became
            my focus. But tech sneaked in during another round of that competition. I hopped on the coding train,
            learning Python and then diving into frontend languages.
            <br><br>
            In this pursuit, a revelation struckâ€”why pick just one passion? Enter product management: a blend of
            creativity, business, and tech. It's like discovering the perfect mix for my interests. To level up, I've
            taken on competitions, joined clubs, and dived deep into learning. My leadership skills sharpened as Vice
            President at GBDA Society and Technical Director at QTPOC, while my hunger for learning led me through
            Harvard's Computer Science course (CS50) and into Google's UX Design Certification.
            <br><br>
            Now, here I am, pumped to bring this mix of creativity, business chops, and tech wizardry to the table in my
            upcoming co-op in Fall 2024.
