## The problem

This was one of the most specific problems I had. My resume is two pages and every time I customized it for a company, Figma forced me to export each page as a separate PDF. Then came the song and dance: upload both files to a PDF merger, wait for it to process, download and rename it to “Gaurav Shah - Resume - Company Name.pdf.” It was ridiculous for something so small.

I wanted to keep the personal touch of customizing each application, so I didn’t want to automate that part. But exporting faster? That I could fix.

## Implementation

The resume joiner is a vibe coded project built as a simple web-app. Since the tool is only meant for for solo use, so instead of building out an extensive backend, I decided to use `localStorage` to house data.

## The solution

I believe in showing, not telling. So, instead of a long-winded explanation, why don’t you play around with the tool yourself? If you’d prefer a step-by-step walkthrough, keep scrolling.
