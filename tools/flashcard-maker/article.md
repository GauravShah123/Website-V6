## The problem & process

It was 12 AM in a quiet study room. My friend was surrounded by notes, venting about how much she had left to do. She was still finishing up her notes, then she needed to flashcards and revise them. The problem? Quizlet had gone paid, and she didn’t know what free tools were still worth using. It was frustrating having to go on the hunt for a new tool 14 hours before an exam. So, instead of wasting more time hunting, she sighed and pushed the thought aside.

That’s when I remembered GPT-5 had just dropped. I figured, why not? While she hammered through her notes, I spun up a simple flashcard maker in minutes. She got the tool she needed, and I got to test the new model with a quick win. Over then next hour, I continued adding improvements. It was so much fun to just build and see something work. When I showed her the tool, she was so excited to use it! She still mentions how much it helped her every time I see her.

## Implementation

The Flashcard maker is a vibe coded project built as a simple web-app. I kept this tool as simple as possible: plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with localStorage for persistence. Since the tool is only meant for for solo use, so instead of building out an extensive backend, I decided to use `localStorage` to house data.

## The solution

I believe in showing, not telling. So, instead of a long-winded explanation, why don’t you play around with the tool yourself? If you’d prefer a more step-by-step walkthrough though, click on the scribe link.
