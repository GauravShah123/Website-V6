        <h1>Why Product?</h1>
        <p>I want to work in product because it feels like the place where everything I care about comes together. I love understanding users, solving real problems, and figuring out how to take messy, complicated ideas and turn them into something that actually works for people. Being able to go from talking to a customer one day to shaping a roadmap the next is exciting to me. It makes the work feel alive.
<br><br>
            Product pulls from every part of how I think. I love digging into the details, but I also love stepping back and asking if we are solving the right problem in the first place. It is one of the few roles where you get to care about the user, the business, and the team all at once. That balance is something I am genuinely excited to take on.
            
<br><br>
            With my background across UX, business, and tech, it feels natural to want to build things that are not just functional, but thoughtful. I want to work in product because I love creating things that make people’s lives better in small but real ways. And because I know there is nothing better than seeing an idea come to life and realizing it actually made a difference.
