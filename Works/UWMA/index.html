        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The UW Marketing Association (UWMA) needed to rebrand after a temporary shutdown due to COVID restrictions,
            as their old design failed to reflect the club's fun and creative nature.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>I led a rebranding effort that involved creating a modern letter mark logo, a vibrant color scheme, sleek
            typography, and various logo variations. The brand book and guidelines provided a cohesive identity and
            allowed room for creativity.

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>The rebranding led to a 423% increase in engagement, 316% increase in post interactions, and 700% increase in
            profile visits. The unique identity helped UWMA stand out and attract more people to their social media and
            activities.</p>

            <h2>A new design for a new identity</h2>
            <p>The UW Marketing Association (UWMA) is an up and coming club at the University of Waterloo. While was
                originally started in the spring of 2021, it had to be shut down due to a new wave of COVID
                restrictions. The club restarted in the fall of 2022 with a new vigour to spread the love of marketing
                among UW students. </p>
            <h3>A new vision</h3>
            <div class="text-image-container">
                <p class="first">To start afresh, we knew that we needed a redesign to truly reflect our brand. UWMA is
                    fun, creative
                    and collaborative. Our old beige and black design did not communicate that. Being the only marketing
                    focused club on campus, we are the hub for all students with an interest in marketing, and trust us,
                    there’s a lot of students who fit that description.
                </p>

            <h2>Distilling a brand</h2>
            <p>Distilling the brand identity of such a diverse club was not an easy task, however, an interview with the
                president revealed a few key priorities.</p>
            <h3>A modern look</h3>
            <p>To achieve a modern look and feel, I chose to go with a <b> geometric letter mark</b>. While the original
                idea was to include all the letters of UWMA, I soon pivoted to just MA (Marketing Association) to avoid
                redundancies. Being in located at the University of Waterloo, the UW can be implied.</p>
            <p>I tested several variations of putting together the 2 letters and landed on something that felt just
                right. See some of our sketches below (Recreated digitally).</p>
            <br>
            <img src="/works/UWMA/2.png" alt="Logo Ideas">
            <h3 class="first">Fun and passionate</h3>
            <p>The best way, in my opinion, to accomplish this was through the strategic use of colour. While
                red is the first colour that comes to mind when thinking about passion, I decided against it
                because of it’s alarming nature. Green, I realized, can convey passion while being welcoming as
                well. <b>Mint</b> (#3FCB99) served the purpose perfectly. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Adding accents</h4>
            <p>A <b>complementary colour scheme</b> would bring energy to our designs, however I also needed to
                ensure that our colours were subdued enough to work in real world contexts. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Adding Depth</h4>
            <p>Gradients, when used well can add a lot of visual interest to a design, however, they go wrong just as
                easily. To prevent the misuse of gradients, I put together a few approved gradients for our future
                designs. The idea with these gradients was to keep them simple and subtle. <br><br></p>
            <h4>Neutrals to complete the look</h4>
            <p>I decided against using solid white and solid black for accessibility reasons. Putting those two
                colours on top of each other can create uncomfortable levels of contrast. Hence we chose an off
                white and navy blue to be our neutral colours.</p>

            <h3>Sleek and versatile typography</h3>
            <p>Admittedly, typography is not my strong suit and I had support from my supervisor while choosing our
                fonts. We restricted ourselves to google fonts for easy use by all team members and integration with the
                website. We settled on simple, yet versatile set of fonts.</p>
            <img src="/works/UWMA/4.png" alt="UWMA Typography">
            <h3>Same brand, different forms</h3>
            <p>With any logo, it’s important to design for various applications. While our primary logo form was
                complete, we still had to account for variations in colour and layout.</p><br>
            <div class="text-image-container">
                <div class="image-container">

                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
            <p>I created brand book to showcase our design guidelines and help in the onboarding of any new designers. I
                also added some patterns and backgrounds at the end to serve as inspiration. </p>
            <h3>Considering future members</h3>
            <p>While compiling the file, I made sure to create components and record text and colour styles in the
                document to help future design team members. While the rebranding was complete, it was also important to
                ensure that it was as easy as possible to follow to follow the brand guidelines.</p>
            <br><img src="/works/UWMA/8.png" alt="UWMA Brand Book and Working File">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>We here at UWMA embrace creativity. Our brand guidelines left room for designers to adapt and embrace
                their own style as well. The guide was mainly used for our social media posts so far, however with a
                case competition coming up in the Winter 2023, the applications will grow multifold.</p>
            <h3>Instagram Posts</h3>
            <br><img src="/works/UWMA/9.svg" alt="Instagram posts designed by yours truly">

            <div class="impact-wrapper">
                <h2 class="impact-title">Impact</h2>
                <p>After the rebrand, we noticed a lot more engagement with posts. Our unique identity let us stand out
                    from
                    other club posts and attract more people to our Instagram and Linktree.</p>
                <div class="impact-container">
                    <div class="impact">
                        <h3 class="big-number">423%</h3>
                        <p>increase in engagement</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="impact">

                        <p>increase in post interactions</p>

                        <p>increase in profile visits</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <h3>🤩 Full creative control is really rewarding</h3>
            <p>Having done a lot of design work in the past, I was confident about my abilities going into this project,
                however throughout the course of the term I learnt more that I thought possible. I had the chance to
                work with so many skilled people and learn a lot. I performed a lot of research to make sure I did this
                project right and I feel like it paid off. </p>
            <p>For example, while choosing accent colours led to me down a rabbit hole to learn about accessibility and
                how black and white may actually cause some accessibility issues.</p>

            <h3>🖼️ It’s a lot more than a logo</h3>
            <p>While I saw examples of brand books in the past, creating one was a very different experience. The sheer
                number of considerations was beyond my expectations. Distilling a brand identity goes way beyond a logo.
                It was really fun thinking strategically about a colour scheme, typography, etc.</p>

            <h3>👁️ Everyone has a different interpretation</h3>
            <p>While the brand book can provide a general guideline, every designer is going to have a different
                interpretation of how to use the guides. For example, the design team began using the subheading font
                more in the Instagram posts. It is important to leave room for creativity as long as their is a cohesive
                identity.</p>
