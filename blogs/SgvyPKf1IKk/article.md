The job of a product designer is often misunderstood. Yes, we do make decisions like “that button colour should be blue”, but we spend much less time on things like that than you might think. Especially in a lean team. When I worked at a startup, it was not uncommon for me to spend less than 40% of my time in Figma. Most of my role was really about shaping product direction, talking to users and keeping engineering unblocked.

In this article, I want to share my perspectives on the product design role in lean product teams.  

## Designers as product builders

When a team doesn’t have a PM, the designer naturally absorbs parts of that role. In past design roles, I’ve run user interviews, looked at churn data, and mapped competitors to understand gaps. These activities are not side projects. They are extensions of the design process, because building the right product is inseparable from building the right interface.

In small teams, design also often becomes the primary alignment tool. Founders may have an abstract strategy in their head. Engineers may know what’s technically feasible. But until someone translates that into flows and prototypes, there’s no shared picture of the product. Even at Blueprint, I saw our designers take abstract visions of functionality and transform them into mocks that we could use to align engineering, product and the client.

Designers provide that bridge. A single mockup can turn a vague strategy into something a team can rally behind. In lean teams, I’ve found that this ability to communicate visually and strategically is often as valuable as the interface itself.

## Knowing where polish matters

In lean teams, polish is a resource. It cannot be applied everywhere, and as a designer, you make the judgment call of when to invest the team’s limited time.

Here, knowing the difference between bets and core flows is extremely useful. Let me break it down. Bets are experiments: new functionality where adoption is uncertain. Bets should move quickly. You aren’t shipping with their final state. You’re shipping the bare minimum to see if people will use it and if it’s worth investing time in building it properly.

Core flows, on the other hand, demand trust. Transactions in fintech, onboarding in enterprise software, or outputs in AI products. These are the places where polish is not cosmetic. It shapes whether a user believes the product is competent, safe, and worth returning to.

Unlike larger teams where bets are alpha and beta tested before release, the benefit of a lean team is that you can test value in production. You get significantly better data. 

The value in lean teams is the speed of the engineering team. If they can build quickly, you can test directly with customers. This is where product polish has to take a back seat.

This judgment is harder than it looks. A designer who polishes everything will slow the team down. A designer who polishes nothing will erode user trust. The skill is in spotting which flows carry more weight and allocating energy accordingly.

## Working across zoom levels

Design requires you to shift between different zoom levels. At the lowest, it’s typography and layouts. At the middle, functionality and flows. Even higher, decisions about product strategy.

The trap though, is getting stuck. Designers who never leave the lowest zoom can create the most beautiful but irrelevant work. Designers who never drop down from the high zoom can make decisions that don’t hold up under real use. Being a great designer does not come not from being great at one zoom level, but from moving fluidly between them.

Caveat: The cost of switching levels is real. Research and strategy demand a different mode of thinking than pixel-level execution. If you force your brain to back and forth very quickly, you’ll tire yourself out and not do your best at any level. I’ve found that structuring work so each level has its own time allows for sharper output at all three.

## Avoiding the bottleneck

In most lean teams, designers are outnumbered by engineers. The risk of becoming a bottleneck is high. A single feature left undefined can hold back multiple engineers.

The real bottleneck isn’t the ratio itself but the lack of clarity. When engineers are unsure what to build, or when requirements shift midstream, the speed of the team collapses. The role of design here is less about making perfect mockups and more about removing ambiguity. The sooner engineers can act with confidence, the more the team maintains momentum.

A lot of the time, I push ideas through rough wireframes, written specs, or quick calls rather than waiting for polished flows. The goal is not to replace quality with speed but to unblock progress while quality catches up.

## A broader definition of design

Most of my contributions in lean teams do not actually involve UI. It might be reframing a user complaint into a problem statement that engineering can solve. It might be spotting that churn isn’t driven by missing features but by confusion in an existing one. It might be simplifying a proposed flow so that it can ship in two days instead of two weeks.

## Conclusion

Design in this environment is about so much more than a button colour. It’s about making choices that unlock progress, whether through clarity, alignment, or user trust. The Figma file is only one of many tools used to get there.

The work is messier and broader than most people assume. But this breadth and impact is what makes me so excited about the role!
