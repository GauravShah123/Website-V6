        <p>As a UX designer turned product manager, I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to balance both worlds.
            This article is a reflection on the
            lessons I learned by doing, messing up, and trying again.</p>
        <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
        <p>In Fall 2024, I was hired as a UX designer at the WSIB Innovation Lab. One of our projects as a team of
            developers and designers was an internal tool called the RTW Accommodations Engine. With a brief on the
            problem statement and a timeline, we got to work.

            <br><br>
            A few weeks into building, the product was going
            in all kinds of directions. Dev and UX weren’t aligned, and no one had a full picture of what the MVP would
            look like. For example. devs were building functionality for features that design wasn't even aware of. This
            chaos felt exactly like a little nudge I needed. Iny my quest to solve this problem, I stepped up to pass
            along information and made sure people were on the same page.
            <br><br>
            Slowly, I started talking to stakeholders more. Over time, I wasn’t
            just a messenger anymore. I became the guy with the answers. I'd wanted to be a PM for a few years now and
            working on this
            tool was the perfect opportunity. This is when I officially began transitioning into the role.<br><br>In
            this journey of becoming a PM, I made a lot of mistakes. The lessons mentioned in this article are
            reflections and learnings from those same mistakes. <br><br>

            My first mistake was letting UX take the lead on feature decisions without checking in with dev. As someone
            from a UX background, I naturally leaned into that side. I trusted that design would make the best product
            decisions. However, a lot of the time, things didn't make sense to dev or dev didn’t have the
            capacity to build everything we designed. I remember having a coffee chat
            with a PM around that time and asking her, “How do I get devs to do what I want them to do?”

            She laughed a bit and said, “You don’t. You bring them into the conversation early and make sure they feel
            heard.” <br><br>

            That was lesson 1. Zoom out and listen to all perspectives early. Dev needs to be a part of product
            conversations, not just an after thought. Turns out, our dev team had a lot of good ideas on how the product
            could serve user needs.
        </p>
        <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
        <p>As we built more of the tool, things got more complicated. There were more features, more edge cases, and
            more requests from stakeholders. The one-pager we had at the start wasn’t cutting it anymore. So, I started
            writing more detailed product requirements. I’d document how each feature worked, how
            different states should behave, and what the expected user outcomes were. Suddenly, dev had fewer questions
            and handoff got faster.
            <br><br>
            But something else also started to happen. The designers felt boxed in. This was one of my early attempts at
            being <i>“thorough” </i>:
        </p> <br>
        <p>
        <ul class="checkbox">
            <li> <input type="checkbox">User is asked to confirm upload </li>
            <ul>
                <li> <input type="checkbox">If user selects “redo upload”, they are taken back to the upload dialog</li>
                <li> <input type="checkbox">If user clicks the X:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> <input type="checkbox">The modal closes</li>
                    <li> <input type="checkbox">The uploaded file is discarded</li>
                    <li> <input type="checkbox">A toast with the text “Upload canceled” will show up for 5 seconds</li>
                </ul>
                <li> <input type="checkbox">If the user clicks on “Continue to verification”, they will see a loading
                    animation and then be redirected to the ‘Accommodation Editing’ page</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p> Super helpful for dev. But it left almost nothing for design
            to figure out. That was lesson 2. Documentation is powerful, but too much of it at the wrong time can take
            away trust and creative control.</p>
        <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
        <p>This is a trap that’s easy to fall into when you come from a design background. You think in screens. So when
            someone mentions a new feature, your brain already jumps to what it could look like. And so, even though I
            wasn’t touching a single frame in Figma, I was still designing. I’d write down product decisions that
            covered user stories, layout, interaction, everything. I didn’t realize I was doing it, but I had taken
            design decisions
            away from the team. Add in a strict design system, and the result was mindless work. Designers were just
            executing, not exploring.
            <br><br>
            So I changed the approach again. I stopped giving solutions. Instead, I brought problems.

            We’d go over the user story together. I gave them space to explore and find ideas. Then, once there was a
            direction, I’d step back in and help with narrowing down the options, refining the user flow, and
            documenting edge cases.

            That was lesson 3. Let designers own the design process. Your job is to support it, not script it.
        </p>
        <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
        <p>We finally had a rhythm. But it didn’t last for every feature. Sometimes dev needed to prototype first.
            Sometimes design needed more research. Sometimes a stakeholder needed to sign off before anything moved
            forward. That’s when I realized that not everything needs the same playbook.

            Some features needed more structure. Others needed more space. I had to ask more questions, gather more
            input, and then figure out what approach made the most sense.

            <br><br>
            That was lesson 4. No single strategy works every time. Stay curious, be flexible, and adapt as you go.
        </p>

        <h2>Lesson 5</h2>
        <p>After WSIB, I transitioned into a PM role at UW Blueprint on the same project I had been designing for:
            Extend-A-Family.

            This came with its own challenges.

            <br><br>

            I had helped build the design system. Now I found myself nitpicking if the right components were being used,
            or if the colour contrast was off. I slipped into low-level feedback without realizing it.

            It felt like I had to defend every detail because I was so close to the work.

            But focusing on the little things meant I stopped asking the big questions. Were we solving the right
            problem? Was this feature even necessary?

            <br><br>

            So I pulled away. I decided to stop commenting on visual design completely and let the design team lead.

            That seemed like the right move, but it wasn’t.

            Without mentorship, we started shipping work that didn’t meet our standards. I’m not saying I had all the
            answers, but I did have context. Drawing a hard line between roles meant I wasn’t showing up for the team in
            the ways I could.

            <br><br>
            That was lesson 5. You don’t need to shut off your design brain. Use your skills with intention. Respect the
            team’s decisions, but know when your perspective adds value.
        </p>
        <h2>Lesson 6</h2>
        <p>I’m still learning how to give better design feedback. I don’t want to micromanage or take away ownership,
            but I can see when something can be better.

            The question is how to share that.

            One thing that helped was something Yuhki Yamashita said: “It’s easy to spot what’s wrong. The hard part is
            understanding why.”

            So now I try to look at the assumptions behind the design. </p>
        <br>
        <ul class="checkbox">
            <li><input type="checkbox">What info were they working with?</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Were they rushed?</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Did they make a tradeoff to save on dev resources?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>By understanding the “why,” we can have a real conversation and figure things out together. I’m not ready to
            call that a lesson yet. But it’s something I’m working on.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            I’m still learning. I’m learning how to support a team without taking control. I’m learning when to lead,
            when to step back, and how to make space for creativity while still driving clarity. What I’ve come to
            realize is that the space between design and product is where I feel the most useful. It’s where I’ve had
            the most impact. I'm grateful to be able to call myself a product manager. It was a dream for so long. I
            can't belive it's now real.

            <br><br>

            I wouldn’t be here without the mentors who supported me. Dima, Sukhi, Olivia, Gavneet, Brooklyn, and
            everyone else -
