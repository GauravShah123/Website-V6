        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>With rising inflation, traditional saving methods became ineffective, making investing a necessity. Our
            survey indicated that 56% of young individuals expressed interest in investing but didn't take action due to
            factors like lack of knowledge, income, fear of loss, and limited time. Negative emotions and a sense of
            alienation further discouraged them from exploring investment opportunities.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>To shift users' mindset towards investing, we leveraged their positive association with e-commerce websites.
            Instead of tying investing to income, we associated it with their spending habits. By asking if they could
            set aside a small percentage of their planned purchase, we gradually introduced them to investing. Our
            browser extension allowed users to save while shopping, offering practical application of learned concepts.
            Our unique value proposition was to help beginners learn and save slowly, ultimately becoming confident
            investors. The browser extension streamlined the process, linking to a website and app for investment
            monitoring and financial education.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>Our project stood out, being selected in the top 4% worldwide. We achieved an impressive 80% user adoption
            rate, generated over 20 promising leads, and identified a total available market of $151M. My key takeaways
            include the significance of process, the nuances of copywriting, and the remarkable benefits of auto-layout
            in Figma.</p>
