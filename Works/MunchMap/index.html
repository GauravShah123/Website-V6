            <p>The TILE Design-a-thon, hosted by UW Blueprint and UW UX, challenged participants to create socially
                impactful solutions with a gamified twist. In response, I designed MunchMap, an app aiming to reduce
                food insecurity on campus.</p>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Here's the deal: College campuses contribute significantly to food waste in North America, with an
                estimated 22 million pounds of edible food thrown away each year. At this very design-a-thon, I
                witnessed firsthand the excess pizza ordered by clubs, many of which were bound to be left uneaten. It
                bothered me to see all that food going to waste when there are so many people who could benefit from it.
                Inspired by this and the number of other club events I had been to with extra food, I had an idea.</p>
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <a class="figma-button"
                href="https://www.figma.com/file/YCDzyGojRtPDnvAxgZFhGW/TILE-Hackathon?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=RVScsEA09OXCxgyh-1"><img

                </span></a>
            <p>Introducing MunchMap, the solution I designed to tackle food waste on college campuses. There are 3 main
                user flows I'd like to demonstrate.</p>
            <h3>User Flow 1 - If you have extra food</h3>
            <p>If a club has extra food, the organizer can simply click on the button on the home page. This takes them
                to a page where they can upload a picture of the food, provide details about what it is, and share their
                location. That's it! The information is then broadcasted to all those seeking food on campus. To speed
                up the process, users can also share the details about the free food on their social media stories,
                especially in the initial stages when we have fewer users. </p>
            <img src="/works/MunchMap/user-flow-1.svg" alt="User Flow 1 - If you have extra food">
            <h3>User Flow 2 - If you‚Äôre looking for food</h3>
            <p>If you‚Äôre looking for food, you can start by selecting your location and setting a search radius in the
                app. MunchMap will then provide you with a list of available food options in your vicinity, along with
                their respective locations. Once you've chosen the food you want, the app will guide you to the place.
                After you've received the food, you have the option to let the organization or club know whether you
                successfully obtained it. This feedback helps them improve the process for future distributions and
                ensures a smoother experience if any issues arise.</p>

            <h3>User Flow 3 - Gamification through Munch Coins</h3>
            <p>Whenever someone gives away or collects food through the app, they earn Munch Coins, symbolizing their
                contribution to waste reduction. Additionally, special achievements unlock badges, adding a sense of
                accomplishment. Users can track their Munch Coins and badges in the profile section of the app.
                Furthermore, at the end of each term, a progress report displays the user's overall performance. While
                Munch Coins serve as a mild motivator for the clubs involved, it's worth considering attaching external
                incentives, such as club funding, if the app becomes a reality.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Upon reflection, I recognize that my initial design for the MunchMap app during the design-a-thon
                primarily focused on the happy path, overlooking potential challenges that may arise during its actual
                implementation. Here are some issues that need to be addressed for the app's large-scale adoption and
                smooth functionality:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Adoption:</b> To ensure the success of MunchMap, it is crucial to achieve widespread adoption
                        from both the clubs and individuals seeking food. Encouragement and support from the student
                        clubs'
                        governing bodies can play a significant role in promoting the app's usage. Additionally, placing
                        informative posters around the campus can raise awareness and encourage participation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Protecting the food:</b> A key concern is ensuring the safety and integrity of the shared
                        food. Implementing a system that prevents food from being left unattended is vital to prevent
                        potential risks, such as contamination or tampering. Setting up designated safe drop-off and
                        pickup locations around campus can help mitigate these concerns and ensure the food remains
                        secure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Tracking food availability:</b>It is crucial to update the app in real-time to reflect the
                        availability of food. Once a user selects a particular food item, it should be promptly removed
                        from the list of options to prevent others from traveling to the location only to find that it
                        has already been claimed. Implementing an efficient tracking system will enhance user experience
                        and prevent unnecessary travel.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Balancing incentives and food management:</b> Introducing incentives like club funding based
                        on food donations raises the concern of potential overordering by clubs to meet the criteria for
                        rewards. This can be seen as a waste of funds if it results in excess food. Striking the right
                        balance between incentives and responsible food management is crucial to ensure that clubs
                        remain mindful of their actual food needs and avoid unnecessary waste.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>I'm thrilled to have secured <b>2nd place</b> among over a 100 participants by leveraging my product
                thinking and providing a solution that aligned with the social good prompt.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <h3 class="no-margin-top">‚è≥ Investing time in the solution</h3>
            <p>
                Despite the time constraint of just 5 hours to create the entire app, I made a conscious effort
                to deeply understand the problem at hand. By devoting time to grasp its nuances and developing a
                solution that could truly address it, I was able to produce a more refined and effective
                outcome.</p>
            <h3>üóùÔ∏è Leveraging existing resources</h3>
            <p>
                The availability of a material UI kit proved to be a game-changer. It significantly reduced the design
                time and effort required, allowing me to focus on the core aspects of the solution. It underscored the
                importance of assessing available resources and utilizing them strategically to optimize the design
                process.</p>
            <h3>ü§® Considering edge cases</h3>
            <p>
                Feedback I received after the competition shed light on the significance of designing for edge cases.
                Although I mentioned their importance in the hindsight section, I realized that incorporating them into
                the initial design process would have resulted in a more comprehensive and well-thought-out solution.
                Taking into account various scenarios and potential outliers enhances the overall usability and user
                experience of the app.</p>
