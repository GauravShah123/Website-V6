        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Since 2018, I’ve been freelancing with startups and non-profits, helping them launch products, clean up user flows, and bring ideas to life. I’ve worked in small teams where I’ve had to wear a lot of hats, move fast, and care deeply about the experience we’re creating for users. As I've transitioned to product, I've continued to keep the user at the center while understanding and implementing the strategy pieces that make a product successful. I'm excited to bring that experience and curiosity to your organization :D</p>
